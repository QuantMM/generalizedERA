abstract = {Functional extended redundancy analysis (FERA) was recently developed to integrate data reduction into functional linear models. This technique extracts a component from each of multiple sets of predictor data in such a way that the component accounts for the maximum variance of response data. Moreover, it permits predictor and/or response data to be functional. FERA can be of use in describing overall characteristics of each set of predictor data and in summarizing the relationships between predictor and response data. In this paper, we extend FERA into the framework of generalized linear models (GLM), so that it can deal with response data generated from a variety of distributions. Specifically, the proposed method reduces each set of predictor functions to a component and uses the component for explaining exponential-family responses. As in GLM, we specify the random, systematic, and link function parts of the proposed method. We develop an iterative algorithm to maximize a penalized log-likelihood criterion that is derived in combination with a basis function expansion approach. We conduct two simulation studies to investigate the performance of the proposed method based on synthetic data. In addition, we apply the proposed method to two examples to demonstrate its empirical usefulness.},

@phdthesis{Hwang2000,
abstract = {A new approach to structural equation modeling based on so-called extended redundancy analysis (ERA) is proposed. In ERA, latent variables are obtained as exact linear combinations of observed variables, and model parameters are estimated by consistently minimizing a single criterion. As a result, the method can avoid limitations of covariance structure analysis (e.g., stringent distributional assumptions, improper solutions, and factor score indeterminacy) in addition to those of partial least squares (e.g., the lack of a global optimization procedure). The method is simple yet versatile enough to fit more complex models; e.g., those with higher-order latent variables and direct effects of observed variables. It can also fit a model to more than one sample simultaneously. Other relevant topics are also discussed, including data transformations, missing data, metric matrices, robust estimation, and efficient estimation. Examples are given to illustrate the proposed method.},

abstract = {An extension of redundancy analysis is proposed that allows analyzing a variety of directional relationships among multiple sets of variables. The proposed method subsumes an existing redundancy analysis method as a special case. It is also extended further to analyze more complex relationships among variables such as direct effects of observed exogenous variables, higher-order components and multi-sample comparisons. An alternating least-squares algorithm is developed for parameter estimation. A small simulation study is conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed method. Two real examples are given to illustrate the empirical use of the proposed method.},

@article{Lee2018,
abstract = {As one possible solution to the “missing heritability” problem, many methods have been proposed that apply pathway-based analyses, using rare variants that are detected by next generation sequencing technology. However, while a number of methods for pathway-based rare-variant analysis of multiple phenotypes have been proposed, no method considers a unified model that incorporate multiple pathways. Simulation studies successfully demonstrated advantages of multivariate analysis, compared to univariate analysis, and comparison studies showed the proposed approach to outperform existing methods. Moreover, real data analysis of six type 2 diabetes-related traits, using large-scale whole exome sequencing data, identified significant pathways that were not found by univariate analysis. Furthermore, strong relationships between the identified pathways, and their associated metabolic disorder risk factors, were found via literature search, and one of the identified pathway, was successfully replicated by an analysis with an independent dataset. Herein, we present a powerful, pathway-based approach to investigate associations between multiple pathways and multiple phenotypes. By reflecting the natural hierarchy of biological behavior, and considering correlation between pathways and phenotypes, the proposed method is capable of analyzing multiple phenotypes and multiple pathways simultaneously.},
